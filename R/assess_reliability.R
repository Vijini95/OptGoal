#' Assess Reliability of Water Release Strategy
#'
#' This function assesses the reliability of the release strategies against demand,
#' calculating time-based reliability, volume-based reliability, vulnerability, and resilience.
#'
#' @param release Numeric vector of release amounts over time.
#' @param demand Numeric vector of demand amounts over time.
#'
#' @return A data frame containing the reliability metrics.
#' @examples
#' \dontrun{
#' reliability_results <- assess_reliability(result$release, demand)
#' print(reliability_results)
#' }
#' @export
