\title{Plot Release and Demand Over Time}
\usage{
plot_release_vs_demand(release, demand, months = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{release}{Numeric vector of release amounts over time.}

\item{demand}{Numeric vector of demand amounts over time.}

\item{months}{Optional character vector of month names corresponding to the data.
If not provided and the length of data is 12, defaults to Jan-Dec.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object displaying the release and demand over time.
}
\description{
This function plots both the release and demand data over time on the same graph,
allowing for easy comparison between the two.
