\title{Assess Reliability of Water Release Strategy}
\usage{
assess_reliability(release, demand)
}
\arguments{
\item{release}{Numeric vector of release amounts over time.}

\item{demand}{Numeric vector of demand amounts over time.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the reliability metrics.
}
\description{
This function assesses the reliability of the release strategies against demand,
calculating time-based reliability, and volume-based reliability.
}

# Using the reservoir_data dataset
